    <p>In July 2017, I created a hatchet blade and a mustang statue using green sand
    casting and lost foam casting.</p>
    <p>The hatchet blade was made by packing green-sand around a
    wooden form, then creating a sprue hole and gate. Then molten aluminum was poured into
    the mold. After it metal cooled, it was placed in a bucket of water and then trimmed to size.</p>
    <p>The mustang was created by using a cnc router to cut the mustang shape out of styrofoam. The 
    styrofoam mustangs were then glued to bases, a runner and riser. The styrofoam pieces were then
    placed into a bucket and packed with fine grain sand. A ceramic pipe was then placed around the
    riser to direct the molten aluminium toward the styrofoam. After the metal cooled, it was removed
    from the sand and placed in a bucket of water before being trimmed off the runner.</p>
